# A Cat's Quest 80% Completed

A Cat's Quest is a small adventure game designed to have players spend their time in a relaxing, cozy virtual neighborhood. My 80% completed demo consists of the starting scene, in addition to completing one 'quest' before the completed demo will consist of the companion cat Bella, assisting the player in finding their way back home. Media integration, including audio and BGM was not captured in the video but is included.
